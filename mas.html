          I am a prospective graduate student for the Media Arts and Sciences
          program and below is a portfolio subset I would like to share.

            <b>Learning how to write Chinese logograms -</b> This is a prototype system
          to help a user improve their ability to write characters. It uses
          a convolutional neural network to classify what the user has drawn
          so far in order to give feedback. Further information can be found
          on the page below the interface itself.

            <b>A news reporting agency and media production hybrid company -</b> During
          the MAS.S64 Sci Fab: Science Fiction-Inspired Prototyping class
          I projected out a possible trajectory for society in the year 2050
          and a company that could have risen during that time. On the page
          located through the link there is a recorded video presentation
          made where I acted as the CEO for this company presenting to a class
          on the company's history, and there is the projection report I
          created.
