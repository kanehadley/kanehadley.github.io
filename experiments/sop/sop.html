        Here are instructions on how to use the SOP generator. You'll notice
        there are roughly four sections. There is a list of pages in the
        upper left, an empty (though soon to be populated) area to the upper
        right, a list of pages in the lower left, and a text box in the lower
        right. The top two sections show the SOP booklet and the bottom two
        sections allow you to edit the booklet's contents. Currently none of
        the changes are saved to any database. It is all located here on this
        html page and held in memory using javascript. When you reload the
        html page everything will be wiped clean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on any of the pages in the upper left. It'll populate the viewer
        to the upper right with the text for that page. You'll notice it'll
        also create blue links to different pages that you can navigate to.
        Clicking on these links will lead you to pages in the same way as
        the navigation on the left. Hopefully there are descriptive names
        for the links to say which page they turn to. We'll get into
        that next.
      </p>

      <p>
        Click on any of the pages in the lower left page listing. The editor
        to its right will be populated.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the text box is the page contents. Below that you'll see a pair(s)
        of text boxes. These are the links that you saw appearing above in
        blue. You can freely change the text in the text box. You can also
        freely change the link text to what you what in the link box on the
        left. In the link box on the right put the page number that you want
        the link to send you to. When you're done changing the information
        press "Save". When you next click on that page number it'll show the
        new contents (I haven't made it auto update the viewer contents in
        the upper right on saving yet).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to add more links press the "Add Link" button. Currently
        you cannot delete links. There is also no error checking so it would
        be wise to only add numbers to the page number part of the link.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to add more pages press the "Add Page" button. It'll
        update the page navigators with the new page. The page begins empty
        with no links.
