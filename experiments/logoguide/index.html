      <p>
        1) Select a character to draw from the dropdown menu. Each character
           is prepended by whether it is a traditional or simplified
           character.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) In the center panel you will see what is the next partial
           character that must be made. Complete your drawing in the
           Sketchpad to match the partial character.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) Click "Classify" to get feedback on which character the
           classifier most recognizes your partial drawing as matching.
      </p>
      <p>
        4) Click "Next" and repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until you have drawn
           a character that matches the Goal panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        5) Pick a new character from the dropdown menu to practice on that
           new character.
      </p>
    <h1>Description:</h1>
    <p>
      LogoGuide is a prototype system to help a user learn how to write
      Chinese logograms. It does so by breaking the character down in stages
      in order to learn how to draw the character by each stroke. After
      drawing a step the user can get feedback by running the trained
      convolutional neural network in order to see how closely it matches to
      images that have been trained on.

        During the <a href="http://futureai.media.mit.edu/">MAS.S63 Cognitive Integration</a> course I presented on the
      system and future directions as I've outlined here:
